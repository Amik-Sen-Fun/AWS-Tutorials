# Cloud Computing 

Cloud refers to internet or network, that is present in a remote location. 

Cloud computing refers to the manipulation, configuration and accessing remote resources. 

It is based on service models namely: 

- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS):
  - You get access to the servers only. Used primarily for hosting. 

- Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS):
  - You get access to the servers and middlewares. Used primarily for Building. 

- Software-as-a-Service (SAAS):
  - You get access to servers, middleware and applications based on the middleware. Used primarily for Consuming. 

Risk associated with cloud computing: 
- Security and Privacy 
- Isolation Failure 
- Lock in 
- Management Interface Compromise
- Insecure or incomplete data deletion 

# Regions in AWS
- They are geographical regions that host two or more availability zones. 
- Important to consider location because it helps in optimizing latency and minimize cost. 
- You can deploy application to multiple regions and improve user experience 
- Regions are seperate from one another and data is not replicated from one to another automatically. 

# Availability Centers
- These are collection of data centres in a region. 
- These datacenters are fast but connnected by a low latency fast link
